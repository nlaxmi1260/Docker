    <h3>Basic Terms in Docker</h3>
        <ol>
                <li> 
                    <b> Web Servers </b>: A web server is a software application (or hardware device) that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to clients (usually web browsers) over the Internet. <br>
                    A web server’s primary role is to serve web pages for a website . A web page can be rendered from a single HTML file, or a complex assortment of resources fitted together. If you want to host your web application on the internet, in many cases you will need a web server. <br>
                    The most popular open source web servers are currently <b> Apache and Nginx </b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Containerisation</b>: The process of containing applications, along with its code and libraries in one environment or container,running on more than one platform to make the DevOps delivary pipeline simplified and portable is known as containerization.
                    <ol>Key Concepts In Containerisation:
                        <li>
                            <b>Containers</b>: Containers are lightweight, standalone and executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime , system tools ,liabraries and settings. </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Docker</b>: The most popular platform for containerization is Docker. Docker provides tools to create ,deploy and manage containers. It uses a DockerFile to define the steps to create a container image, which is a snapshot of the container.

                                            Definition: A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                                Characteristics:
                                                Images are read-only; once built, they cannot be modified directly.
                                                They are layered, meaning each image can inherit from another image, reducing redundancy.

                <b> Docker VS Virtual Machine</b> :
                unlike VMs that virtualize entire hardware ,Docker containers share the host OS Kernel , making them more efficient and faster. COntainers use fewer resources and start almost instantly.
